Lab: Captain's Log

As far as I know, all aspects of the work have been correctly implemented.

I did not collaborate with any other students on this lab, although I did learn
how to respond to a user pressing "enter"/"return" hey in a textbox on
StackOverflow, which I have noted with a comment above the code in question.

I spent approximately two hours on this assignment.
