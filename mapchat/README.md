Assignment 2: Mapchat

As far as I know, all aspects of the work have been correctly implemented.

I did not collaborate with any other students on this assignment, although
I did find inspiration for certain chunks of my code in Ming's examples and
in online sources such as StackOverflow. When I used code that had been helped
with ideas from an outside source, I was sure to make that fact clear above
the code with a comment.

I spent approximately five hours on this assignment. (It was really fun!)
