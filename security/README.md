Assignment 4: Security and Privacy Assessment of Client-Side and Server-Side
(Assignments 2 and 3)


As far as I know, all aspects of the work have been correctly implemented.
However, there are always more potential security issues and vulnerabilities
to be found.

I have discussed this assignment with Julie Sanduski, as her Assignments 2
and 3 were the ones I was analyzing for security. I have also utilized online
resources such as stackoverflow. Wherever and whenever I made use of such
resources, I have made a note of this and have linked to the page in question.
Finally, the wonderful comp20 TAs, including Yotam and John, also helped me
to consider various security vulnerabilities.

I have spent approximately seven hours completing this assignment.
