Lab: Finalizing your Learning Portfolio

12/8/2015

The purpose of this Git repository is to store and display the work that I
have done over the course of this semester in comp20 (Web Programming).

My favorite assignment was Assignment 3. I came into this course with
somewhat of a background in web programming, as I worked on the frontend
of a webapp this past summer. Assignment 3 was my favorite because it
challenged me to do something that was actually completely new to me-
creating server APIs. I had never done anything like this before, so it was
difficult. However, it was a lot more rewarding when I finally got the
server to work, and understood how all the pieces of the web application fit
together.

I have grown a lot from day 1 of this course until now. I did have some
web programming experience prior to this course, but I did not have any
formal education on the topic. Because of this, there were things that I
knew how to do when programming in JavaScript or HTML, but I didn't really
understand why. For example, I knew how to use localStorage, but I didn't
truly understand what it was or the pros and cons. I could get things to
work, but my method was more Googling and theory-testing than true
understanding. This course was so important for me because it gave me an
understanding of what web browsers actually do, why certain things are
asynchronous, and the other big ideas of web programming. I have noticed a
difference in my programming when I go to write code for a web app. The whole
process has gotten more rewarding and interesting because I actually understand
it.

In this course, I learned practical skills for how to be a good programmer.
The course went beyond teaching me how to do web programming, and highlighted
some big ideas that are necessary for anyone to be successful in computer
science. One example of these ideas is how to find answers to my questions. I
learned how to best take advantage of the resources available to me, including
StackOverflow, Google, and the course staff. This has already saved me many
frustrating hours of trying to answer my questions on my own (re-inventing the
wheel), and will surely continue to save me time in the future. Another example
of tangible and transferrable knowledge that this course has left me with is a
better understanding of career-oriented topics, such as interviewing and
networking. I found the conversations we had about these topics, and the guest
lecturers who spoke on these topics (Mike Champion and Robin Kahan) to be
extremely helpful. I spent much of this semester searching and interviewing for
summer internships, and during career fairs and interviews I would often use the
tips I learned in class. (I also had many interviews that asked me questions
about web programming, such as what happens when a web browser loads a page,
that I would not have been able to answer prior to this course but I was able
to answer because of it, so thank you!)

Now that I have finished this course, I would love to delve deeper into the
topic of serverside programming. I had never really done this type of
programming prior to taking the course, but now that I have I really enjoy it.
I would love to learn more about implementing APIs and serverside code, and to
get more practice in the matter. I think it's so fascinating how the frontend
and backend of a webapp interact, and how nuanced this interaction is.
